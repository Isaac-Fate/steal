# Steal

A CLI tool for multipart downloading. 

## Motivation

Downloading large datasets and other resources in a server is slow ðŸ˜´ using `wget` since it is a single-threaded downloader.
So, I want to write a Rust CLI tool that can download multiple segments of a large file in parallel.

I am always happy to learn and collaborate with others ðŸ˜€. 
Please feel free to open issues or reach out to me.

## Installation

### Installing with Cargo

Simply run

```sh
cargo install steal
```

### Installing from Source

- Clone my GitHub repository https://github.com/Isaac-Fate/steal.git
- Navigate to `steal` directory
- Run `cargo install --path .` to install it locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Isaac-Fate/steal.git
cd steal
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To download a large file at `<URL>`, type

```sh
steal <URL>
```

For example, to download 200 MB dummy data from `http://ipv4.download.thinkbroadband.com/200MB.zip`, type

```sh
steal http://ipv4.download.thinkbroadband.com/200MB.zip
```

### Response Headers

You may check the response headers using the sub-command `steal info`.

```sh
steal info <URL>
```
